What is Hedon?
----------------

Hedon is a new digital currency designed to provide payments in and out of the payment system that we will create and that will bear the same name [Hedon Online]. Based on a modern, secure and fast algorithm, with anonymity provided by the Masternodes and the Zerocash protocol, with an elegant way of retargeting the difficulty and large block size to ensure a sufficient number of transactions we believe that Hedon will take its place among the modern recent digital payments.
